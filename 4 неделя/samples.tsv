i have a collection of objects that are guaranteed to be distinct in particular indexed by a unique integer id i also know exactly how many of them there are and the number won t change and was wondering whether array would have a notable performance advantage over hashset for storing retrieving said elements on paper array guarantees constant time insertion since i know the size ahead of time and retrieval but the code for hashset looks much cleaner and adds some flexibility so i m wondering if i m losing anything performance wise using it at least theoretically 	java

i have a listview inside an activity and each of its item is customized to have some textviews along with a dropdownlist item and an imageview inside an onscrolllistener implementation each item of a listview gets populated using an arrayadapter populating text views with values taken from an arraylist and imageview with the jpeg file stored on sd card following is the screenshot of listview item the problem arises when the jpeg file from sdcard is converted to a bitmap i e bitmapfactory decodefile filename and then gets assigned to an image view using setimagebitmap bitmap bmp as the setting bitmap image to an image view is a lengthy process it cannot keep pace with the scroll listener implementation and the imageview of different listview rows gets populated with the image it was assigned to any row above can anybody please suggest some workout to cater this issue specifically the assignment of images from sd card to an imageview its not like my listview item is overloaded with controls that is why i am facing this problem i also have tried it with single imageview item inside each row and it behaves the same way your suggestion to improvise this are welcome and surely

the probably not so well written question is is there any way to get object data right after it is loaded through bpy import_scene obj function i mean when i import an obj file with this function i need to make some more transformation for it when i select an object via name mesh default name of object after import all those functions works for other objects named mesh in my scene i tried to get an last object from objects list in scene but they re arranged alphabeticaly so it didn t worked well when i tried to change object name and apply next functions to it it works only for one all earlier instances of imported object are back to default how to solve that problem is there a option to get from scene last added object or maybe some way to mark obj object right after it is imported before next functions are applied or maybe there is a way to import obj data straight into created earlier blank object cheers regg ps working on blender 2 63 	python
